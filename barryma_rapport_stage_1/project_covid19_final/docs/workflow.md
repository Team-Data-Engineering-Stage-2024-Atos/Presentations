Certainly! Here's a summary of the workflow for your big data project, detailing the steps involved from data ingestion to final analysis and machine learning model deployment:

### Workflow Summary

#### 1. Data Ingestion and Initial Storage
- **Bash Scripts**: Upload raw datasets to HDFS.
  - Script: `upload_datasets.sh`
  - Action: Uploads raw CSV files to HDFS for further processing.

#### 2. Data Cleaning and Processing
- **Hadoop MapReduce Jobs**: Clean and process raw data to handle inconsistencies.
  - Scripts: `CleanAndProcessDataMapper.java`, `CleanAndProcessDataReducer.java`, `CleanAndProcessDataDriver.java`
  - Action: Reads, cleans, and processes raw CSV files, and stores the cleaned data in HDFS.
  - Script: `run_clean_and_process.sh`

- **Hadoop MapReduce Jobs**: Split comma-separated values in US datasets.
  - Scripts: `SplitUSDataMapper.java`, `SplitUSDataReducer.java`, `SplitUSDataDriver.java`
  - Action: Splits columns with comma-separated values in the US datasets and stores the split data in HDFS.
  - Script: `run_split_us_data.sh`

#### 3. Data Transformation and Analysis
- **Spark Jobs**: Perform data transformation, feature engineering, aggregation, and analysis.
  - Scripts:
    - `EnhancedBasicStatistics.scala`
    - `EnhancedDataCleaning.scala`
    - `EnhancedFeatureEngineering.scala`
    - `EnhancedDataAggregation.scala`
    - `EnhancedTimeSeriesAnalysis.scala`
    - `EnhancedMachineLearningModel.scala`
  - Actions:
    - Load datasets from HDFS, clean data, transform and engineer features.
    - Aggregate data, perform time series analysis, and train machine learning models.
    - Save processed data and trained models back to HDFS.

#### 4. Data Storage and Querying in Hive
- **Hive Queries**: Create and manage tables in Hive, transform and aggregate data.
  - Scripts:
    - `EnhancedCreateTables.hql`
    - `EnhancedTransformData.hql`
  - Actions:
    - Create tables for raw and cleaned data.
    - Partition data, perform transformations, and create materialized views for efficient querying.

#### 5. Interactive Data Analysis with Jupyter Notebooks
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Perform exploratory data analysis, data transformation, visualization, and machine learning.
  - Notebooks:
    - `EnhancedEDA_PySpark.ipynb`: Perform exploratory data analysis using PySpark.
    - `DataTransformation_FeatureEngineering.ipynb`: Clean, transform data, and add new features.
    - `Analysis_Visualization.ipynb`: Aggregate data and visualize results.
    - `MLModelTraining_Evaluation.ipynb`: Train and evaluate a machine learning model.
    - `HiveDataLoading_Analysis.ipynb`: Load data from Hive, perform basic analysis, and save cleaned data back to Hive.
    - `HiveAdvancedAnalysis.ipynb`: Perform advanced analysis on data from Hive and visualize the results.

#### 6. Workflow Orchestration with Airflow
- **Airflow DAG**: Orchestrate the entire data processing pipeline.
  - Script: `big_data_pipeline.py`
  - Actions:
    - Define tasks for each stage of the pipeline.
    - Schedule and manage dependencies between tasks.
    - Ensure data flows seamlessly from ingestion to final analysis and model deployment.
